## 🌌 Overview

The **Resonance Engine** is a physics simulation suite that does not presuppose the existence of space, time, particles, or forces. Instead, it starts from a minimal set of information-theoretic axioms and demonstrates how classical reality emerges from the dynamics of a quantum graph.

This project serves as the computational proof-of-concept for the **Substrate Framework**, demonstrating that fundamental physical laws—from the Pauli Exclusion Principle to the Strong Nuclear Force—can be derived as emergent properties of a unitary, gauge-invariant network.

## 📐 The Axioms

The engine is built on three non-negotiable rules:

1.  **Hilbert Space Realism:** The fundamental object is the state vector $|\Psi\rangle$. Space is not a container; it is a network of relations between basis states.
2.  **Unitary Evolution:** Time evolution is strictly unitary ($U = e^{-iHt}$). There is no "wavefunction collapse" in the fundamental ontology.
3.  **Geometry is Memory:** Forces are not external laws. They are the energy costs associated with deforming the gauge field (history) on the graph links.

## 🚀 Installation

The engine requires Python 3.8+ and standard scientific computing libraries.
